## Description

Uses [Jep](https://github.com/ninia/jep) to load and execute the original `deep-eos` TensorFlow code from [Stefan Schweter](https://github.com/stefan-it).
The model included in this repository was also published with the original `deep-eos` code (find the models [here](https://github.com/dbmdz/deep-eos#development-set)).
